In MIPS assembly, `$v0` is a register that holds the **system call code**. Think of it as telling the operating system which specific service you want to use.

The number `4` is the specific code for the `print_string` service. When you put `4` into `$v0` and then execute the `syscall` instruction, you are telling the system: "Please print the null-terminated string whose starting address is in register `$a0`."

Here is a list of common system calls used in MIPS, especially with simulators like MARS and SPIM. The code is placed in `$v0`, and arguments (if any) are placed in `$a0`, `$a1`, etc., before making the `syscall`.

| Service                    | Code in `$v0` | Arguments                                              | Result                              |
| :------------------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **print_int**              | 1             | `$a0` = the integer to print                           |                                     |
| **print_float**            | 2             | `$f12` = the float to print                            |                                     |
| **print_double**           | 3             | `$f12` = the double to print                           |                                     |
| **print_string**           | 4             | `$a0` = address of the string                          |                                     |
| **read_int**               | 5             |                                                        | integer is returned in `$v0`        |
| **read_float**             | 6             |                                                        | float is returned in `$f0`          |
| **read_double**            | 7             |                                                        | double is returned in `$f0`         |
| **read_string**            | 8             | `$a0` = address of buffer, `$a1` = length of buffer    |                                     |
| **sbrk (allocate memory)** | 9             | `$a0` = number of bytes to allocate                    | address of allocated block in `$v0` |
| **exit**                   | 10            |                                                        |                                     |
| **print_character**        | 11            | `$a0` = character to print                             |                                     |
| **read_character**         | 12            |                                                        | character is returned in `$v0`      |
| **open_file**              | 13            | `$a0` = address of filename, `$a1` = flags             | file descriptor in `$v0`            |
| **read_from_file**         | 14            | `$a0` = file descriptor, `$a1` = buffer, `$a2` = count | bytes read in `$v0`                 |
| **write_to_file**          | 15            | `$a0` = file descriptor, `$a1` = buffer, `$a2` = count | bytes written in `$v0`              |
| **close_file**             | 16            | `$a0` = file descriptor                                |                                     |
| **exit2**                  | 17            | `$a0` = exit code                                      |                                     |

So, in your code:
1.  `li $v0, 4`: You load `4` into `$v0` to select the `print_string` service.
2.  `la $a0, prompt_a`: You load the memory address of your string `prompt_a` into `$a0` as the argument for the service.
3.  `syscall`: You tell the system to execute the requested service.
