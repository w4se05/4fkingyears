A general consent to a broker is invalid for third-party marketing unless the specific controller (Lufthansa) is named. There is no valid legal basis for this processing.|
|**2.**|**NO: Compliance with Legal Obligation**|• Transmits PNR data to U.S. CBP.<br><br>  <br><br>• Required by EU-US PNR Agreement (EU Directive 2016/681).<br><br>  <br><br>• Passengers informed during booking.|**This is not a violation.** It complies with **Article 6(1)(c)** as the processing is necessary for a legal obligation, and transparency requirements under Article 13 were met.|
|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Conditions for Consent (Freely Given)**|• App forces contact list access to book flights.<br><br>  <br><br>• Denying consent causes repeated pop-ups.|**This is a violation** of **Article 7(4)**. Consent is not "freely given" if a service is conditional on unnecessary data access. Contact lists are not required to book a flight. The pop-ups constitute coercion.|
|**4.**|**YES: Violation of Purpose Limitation**|• HR shared employee performance/salary data with a recruiter for another airline without consent.|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(b) and Article 6**. Data collected for employment cannot be repurposed for third-party recruitment without a valid legal basis or consent.|

|**1.**|**YES: Violation of Breach Notification**|• Breach confirmed March 5th; DPA notified March 20th.<br><br>  <br><br>• Delay of 15 days.|**This is a violation** of **Article 33**. Breaches must be reported without undue delay and no later than 72 hours. Waiting 15 days exceeds this limit without justification.|
|**2.**|**YES: Violation of Processor / Int. Transfers**|• Indian support agents access medical history.<br><br>  <br><br>• No data protection clauses or SCCs in the contract.|**This is a violation** of **Article 28 and Chapter V**. Transfers to third countries (India) require safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses, and processors require a valid Data Processing Agreement.|
|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Purpose Limitation (Special Category Data)**|• Health data used to market sleep apnea machines.<br><br>  <br><br>• Original consent was only for "improving products."|**This is a violation** of **Article 9 and Article 5(1)(b)**. Health data requires explicit consent for specific purposes. "Improving products" does not cover cross-selling/marketing.|
|**4.**|**YES: Violation of DPIA (Prior Consultation)**|• High-risk AI feature launched despite DPIA flagging risks.<br><br>  <br><br>• No safeguards implemented before launch.|**This is a violation** of **Article 36**.

|**No.**|**GDPR Violation**|**Supported facts**|**Violation analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1.**|**YES: Violation of Fairness / Automated Decision Making**|• Credit limits lowered based on postcode (Molenbeek) regardless of financial profile.|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(a) and Article 22**. Using location as a proxy for socio-economic status is discriminatory and violates the principle of fairness.|
|**2.**|**NO: Information Exception**|• Suspicious activity reported to authorities without notifying the customer.|**This is not a violation.** It complies with **Article 23**, which allows restrictions on transparency obligations to safeguard the prevention/detection of criminal offenses (Anti-Money Laundering).|
|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Consent (Bundling)**|• Single checkbox to share data with 3 different partners (fintech, insurance, retail).|**This is a violation** of **Article 7**. Consent must be granular. Bundling consent for distinct partners/purposes prevents it from being "specific" and "freely given."|
|**4.**|**YES: Violation of Storage Limitation**|• Data retained 5 years post-closure for marketing.<br><br>  <br><br>• No specified retention policy.|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(e)**.

|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Purpose Limitation**|• Test drive data shared with marketing firm despite form saying "internal purposes only."|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(b) and Article 13**. Customers were deceived; sharing with a third party is incompatible with the stated "internal" purpose.|
|**4.**|**YES: Violation of Right to Erasure**|• Backups of location history remained indefinitely after a deletion request.|**This is a violation** of **Article 17**. Erasure requests must cover all copies, including backups. Indefinite retention in disaster recovery systems is non-compliant.|

|**2.**|**YES: Violation of Special Category Data**|• Health conditions (e.g., "likely celiac") inferred from orders and shared.|**This is a violation** of **Article 9**. Inferred health data is special category data. Profiling health without explicit consent is prohibited.|
|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Right to Withdraw Consent**|• Daily harassing notifications sent after user disables location access.|**This is a violation** of **Article 7(3)**.

|---|---|---|---|
|**1.**|**YES: Violation of Storage Limitation**|• Passport images stored indefinitely for "security" without a schedule.|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(e)**. Indefinite storage of full passport images is excessive. Data should only be kept as long as necessary for verification.|
|**2.**|**YES: Violation of International Transfers**|• Uses Article 49 derogations for structural, global transfers to non-adequacy countries.|**This is a violation** of **Article 49**. Derogations are for occasional use only. Systematic transfers require structural safeguards like SCCs or BCRs.|

Pre-ticked boxes are banned. Making refusal significantly harder than acceptance is a non-compliant dark pattern.|
|**2.**|**YES: Violation of Lawfulness**|• Bluetooth used to scan nearby passengers' boarding passes for upgrade suggestions without knowledge.|**This is a violation** of **Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6**. There is no legal basis for unauthorized scanning/collection of third-party personal data via Bluetooth.|
|**3.**|**YES: Violation of Right of Access (Fees)**|• Charged €5 administration fee for standard access requests.|**This is a violation** of **Article 12(5)**. SARs must be free of charge unless manifestly unfounded or excessive. A standard request does not justify a fee.|
|**4.**|**YES: Violation of Transparency**|• Data shared with subsidiaries (Buzz, Malta Air) without naming them in the policy.|**This is a violation** of **Article 13/14**. Users must know the specific recipients of their data to give valid consent for marketing/cross-selling.|
