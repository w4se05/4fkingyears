### 1.1 Overview of Rights

> [!Definition] 🛡️ The Rights of the Data Subject
> The GDPR empowers individuals (data subjects) with specific rights to control their personal data. These rights create corresponding obligations for data controllers.

**The Key Rights:** 
1.  **Right to be informed**
2.  **Right of access**
3.  **Right to rectification**
4.  **Right to erasure** ("Right to be forgotten")
5.  **Right to restriction of processing**
6.  **Right to data portability**
7.  **Right to object**
8.  **Rights regarding automated decision-making and profiling**

### 1.2 Right to Be Informed

> [!Concept] 📢 Transparency in Practice
> Controllers must provide clear, concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible information using clear and plain language .

#### Content of Information (Article 13)
When collecting data, the controller must provide:
* **Identity:** Controller's details and DPO contact.
* **Purpose & Basis:** Why data is processed and the legal basis (e.g., consent, contract).
* **Recipients:** Who else will see the data.
* **Retention:** Storage period or criteria used to determine it .
* **Rights:** Existence of rights (access, rectification, withdrawal of consent).
* **Automated Decision-Making:** Existence of profiling, the logic involved, and consequences .

#### Timing of Information
* **Direct Collection:** Information must be provided **at the time** the data is obtained .
* **Indirect Collection (Third Party):** Information must be provided within a reasonable period (max **one month**) or before disclosure to another party .

#### Methods of Delivery
* **Layered Approach:** Short notices with links to detailed info.
* **Dashboards:** Tools for users to manage preferences.
* **Just-in-Time:** Notices appearing exactly when data is collected.

### 1.3 Right of Access (Subject Access Request)

> [!Definition] 🔍 Right of Access
> Data subjects have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether their data is being processed and, if so, access to **a copy of the data** and supplementary information (purpose, recipients, etc.) .

**Purpose:** To help individuals understand how their data is used and verify lawful processing .

---

### 1.4 Right to Rectification

> [!Definition] ✏️ Right to Rectification
> The right to compel the controller to correct inaccurate data or complete incomplete data without undue delay .

* **Inaccurate Data:** Incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact .
* **Verification:** While accuracy is verified, processing should be **restricted** .

> [!Example] Case Law: *Cemalettin Canli v. Turkey*
> The ECHR found a violation where police reports incorrectly listed an individual as a member of illegal organizations despite no convictions. Systematic collection of incorrect data violated the right to private life .

---

### 1.5 Right to Erasure ("Right to Be Forgotten")

> [!Definition] 🗑️ Right to Erasure
> The right to have personal data deleted without undue delay under specific conditions.

**When does it apply?** 
1.  Data is **no longer necessary** for the original purpose.
2.  Consent is **withdrawn** (and no other legal ground exists).
3.  Data was **unlawfully processed**.
4.  Data subject **objects** (and no overriding legitimate grounds exist).
5.  Compliance with a **legal obligation**.
6.  Data relates to **children** (information society services) .

**Exceptions (Refusal to Erase):**
Erasure can be refused for:
* Freedom of expression/information.
* Legal obligations or public interest (public health, scientific research) .
* Establishment or defense of legal claims.

> [!Example] Case Law: *Google Spain (2014)*
> The CJEU ruled that search engines are "controllers" and individuals can request the removal of links to outdated or irrelevant information (e.g., old insolvency notices) that infringe on privacy, unless public interest prevails (e.g., public figures) .

---

### 1.6 Right to Restriction of Processing

> [!Definition] 🛑 Restriction
> An alternative to erasure. Data is stored but **cannot be processed** further .

**Triggers:**
* Accuracy is contested (restrict while verifying).
* Processing is unlawful, but the user opposes erasure.
* Controller no longer needs data, but the user needs it for legal claims.

**Methods:** Moving data to a separate system, making it unavailable to users, or temporarily removing it from websites .

---

### 1.7 Right to Data Portability

> [!Definition] 📦 Data Portability
> The right to receive personal data provided to a controller in a **structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format**, and to transmit it to another controller .

**Conditions for Application:** 
1.  Legal basis is **Consent** OR **Contract**.
2.  Processing is carried out by **Automated Means** (excludes paper files).


**Goal:** Interoperability (e.g., moving a playlist from one streaming service to another) .

---

### 1.8 Right to Object

> [!Definition] ✋ Right to Object
> Data subjects can object to processing based on **public interest** or **legitimate interests**, citing grounds relating to their **particular situation** .

**Direct Marketing (Absolute Right):**
* If a user objects to direct marketing, the controller **must stop** immediately. There are no exemptions or "balancing" tests .
* This right must be presented clearly and separately from other info .

---

### 1.9 Automated Decision-Making & Profiling

> [!Definition] 🤖 Automated Decision-Making
> Decisions made **solely** by automatic means without human intervention that produce legal effects or significantly affect the individual (e.g., automatic loan rejection).

**Safeguards:**
* **Information:** User must be informed of the **logic involved** and envisaged consequences .
* **Right to Intervention:** Users can request human intervention, express their point of view, and contest the decision (unless authorized by law/contract) .

## 2. 📘 Examples & Applications (Exam Mode)

### Example 1: Right to Erasure vs. Public Interest
> **Using:** Right to Erasure, Google Spain Case 
>
> **Scenario:** A politician requests Google to remove links to news articles about a corruption scandal from 10 years ago, claiming it affects his private life ("Right to be forgotten").
>
> **Analysis:**
> 1.  **Right:** The individual has a right to erasure if data is irrelevant/outdated.
> 2.  **Balancing Test:** The right is not absolute. It must be balanced against the **public interest** in accessing information.
> 3.  **Application:** As a **public figure**, the information regarding corruption is relevant to the public interest.
>
> **Conclusion:** The request would likely be **refused** because the public interest in transparency overrides the politician's privacy right in this specific context.

### Example 2: Portability vs. Access
> **Using:** Portability Criteria 
>
> **Scenario:** A user wants to download their entire transaction history from Bank A to upload it to a budgeting app (Bank B).
> * **Condition Check:**
>     * Is it automated? Yes (digital banking).
>     * Is it based on Contract/Consent? Yes (Service contract).
>
> **Result:** The bank must provide the data in a **machine-readable format** (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON), not just a PDF (which is hard for machines to read). This facilitates **interoperability**.

### Example 3: Automated Decision Making
> **Using:** Profiling & Logic Information 
>
> **Scenario:** A health insurance company uses an AI algorithm to set premiums. A user's premium doubles automatically.
>
> **Rights Violation:**
> * If the company says "The computer decided," they are violating Art. 22.
> * **Requirement:** They must explain the **logic** (e.g., "The algorithm uses factors X, Y, and Z to calculate risk") and allow the user to contest the decision with a human reviewer.

## 3. Summary

* **Transparency:** You must tell people *what* you are doing with their data *before* you do it (Right to be Informed).
* **Access:** People can ask for a copy of their data at any time.
* **Correction:** You must fix wrong data (Rectification).
* **Deletion:** You must delete data if asked, unless you have a good legal reason to keep it (Erasure).
* **Portability:** You must help users move their data to competitors (if technically feasible).
* **Objection:** Users can say "Stop" to processing based on legitimate interests. They can *always* say "Stop" to marketing.
* **Automation:** Computers shouldn't make life-changing decisions without human oversight and explanation.
