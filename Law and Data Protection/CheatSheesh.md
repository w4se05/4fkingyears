### **9. EXAM SCENARIO SOLVER (Algorithm)**

**Q: "Is this lawful?"**

1. **Check Data Type:** Is it Sensitive?
    
    - _Yes:_ Need Art 6 Basis + Art 9 Exception.
        
    - _No:_ Need Art 6 Basis only.
        
2. **Check Basis:** Is the basis valid? (e.g., Was consent pre-ticked? Is legitimate interest valid?)
    

**Q: "Can they share this data?"**

1. **Check Purpose:** Is it compatible with the _original_ purpose? (Principle 2).
    
2. **Check Recipient:** Is it a Transfer outside EU? (Check Adequacy/Safeguards).
    

**Q: "Can the user delete this?"**

1. **Check Basis:** If processed on "Legal Obligation" or "Public Task", Erasure is usually NO.
    
2. **Check Status:** Is the data still necessary? If yes, Erasure is NO.
   
   
# Essay Tips and Tricks
Memorize this 4-paragraph structure. It works for almost any "Critically analyse..." question in Data Protection.

#### **Paragraph 1: The Setup (Definitions & Tension)**

- **Start with:** "In the digital age, there is an inherent tension between [Topic A: Law Enforcement/Security] and [Topic B: Individual Privacy Rights]."
    
- **Define GDPR's Stance:** "The GDPR (Regulation 2016/679) establishes high standards for data protection, particularly regarding 'Special Categories' of data (Article 9) and international transfers (Chapter V)."
    
- **Address the Prompt:** "Conventions like the [Insert Exam Topic, e.g., Hanoi Convention] aim to facilitate cross-border access to evidence. However, they must be analyzed through the lens of GDPR's requirement for 'necessity' and 'proportionality'."
    

#### **Paragraph 2: The "Law Enforcement" Argument (The Justification)**

- _Use your Cheatsheet: Scope & Exemptions._
    
- **Argument:** "Effective prosecution of cybercrime requires rapid access to data (e.g., IP addresses, traffic data)."
    
- **Link to Slides:** "As noted in the lectures, Article 10 allows processing of criminal conviction data but strictly under the control of 'official authority'. Furthermore, Article 23 allows for restrictions of rights for 'prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences'."
    
- **Keywords to drop:** Public Interest, Vital Interests, National Security exemption.
    

#### **Paragraph 3: The "Privacy" Argument (The Critique)**

- _Use your Cheatsheet: Principles & Transfers._
    
- **The Risk:** "However, unfettered access creates risks of mass surveillance and misuse."
    
- **The GDPR Block:** "Under Chapter V (International Transfers), data cannot simply flow to non-EU countries without 'adequate protection' or 'appropriate safeguards' (Slide 08). If a Convention forces companies to hand over data to countries with weak privacy laws, it violates the principle of 'Integrity and Confidentiality'."
    
- **Specific Rights:** "Data subjects risk losing their Article 15 (Access) and Article 17 (Erasure) rights if data is transferred to a jurisdiction without equivalent protections."
    

#### **Paragraph 4: The Synthesis (The Solution)**

- **The Balance:** "To comply with modern frameworks like GDPR, any such convention must include specific safeguards."
    
- **The Checklist:** "It must ensure:
    
    1. **Judicial Oversight:** Access should require a warrant (Lawfulness).
        
    2. **Data Minimisation:** Only collect what is strictly necessary for the specific crime.
        
    3. **Purpose Limitation:** Data collected for cybercrime cannot be used for political profiling."
        
- **Conclusion:** "Ultimately, while fighting crime is legitimate, it cannot override the fundamental right to data protection. The Convention is only compatible with GDPR if it respects the principle of proportionality."

### **VISUALIZING THE ARGUMENT**

### **QUICK TIPS TO REDUCE STRESS**

1. **Use the "Buzzwords":** Even if your argument is weak, using the correct terminology gets points. Always use: _Necessity, Proportionality, Adequacy, Safeguards, Derogations._
    
2. **Cite the Articles:** You don't need the text, just the number.
    
    - **Art 5:** Principles (always relevant).
        
    - **Art 6:** Lawful Basis.
        
    - **Art 9:** Sensitive Data.
        
    - **Art 44-49:** International Transfers.
        
3. **There is no "Right" Answer:** In law essays, you are graded on **how you argue**, not just the conclusion. If you say "The Convention is bad because it violates Article 5," and explain _why_, you get full marks, even if the professor thinks the Convention is good.
