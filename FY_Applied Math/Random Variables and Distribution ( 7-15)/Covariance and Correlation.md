#### **Covariance of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined by:**
$$Cov(X,Y)=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$$
Covariance can be either positive or negative

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $Cov(X,Y)=0$, so $covariance$ can be used to indicate the independence of $X$ and $Y$

#### ***Correlation***
$$Corr(X,Y)=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{ Var(X)Var(Y) }}$$
The correlation takes values between $1$ and $-1$:
- If $Corr(X,Y)>0$, there is a tendency that high values of one random variable are associated with high values of the other and vice versa.
- If $Corr(X,Y)<0$, there is a tendency that low values of one random variable are associated with low values of the other.
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, $Corr(X,y)=0$ (since $Cov(X,Y)=0$)
