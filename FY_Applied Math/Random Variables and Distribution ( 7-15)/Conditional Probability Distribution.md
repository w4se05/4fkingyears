If we want to calculate the conditional probability of event $A$ whose probability values taken by random variable $X$ on the specific value $Y$ when $X$ and $Y$ are already jointly distributed, we will want to use conditional probability
$$p_{i|Y=j}=P(X=i|Y=j)=\frac{P(X=i,Y=j)}{P(Y=j)}=\frac{p_{ij}}{P(Y=j)}$$
#### *Formula Breakdown:*
The basis of conditional probability is:

As mentioned in [[Joint Probability Distribution Function]], $p_{ij}$ illustrate the part $P(A\cap B)$ and remember that $P(Y=j)$ stands for the total probability values of $Y=j$, so basically it stands for $P(B)$ in this scenario
## Conditional 

$$E(X|Y=j)=\sum_{i}i\,p_{i|Y=3}$$
