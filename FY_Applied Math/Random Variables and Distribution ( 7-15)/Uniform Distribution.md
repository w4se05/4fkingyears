This shit is call uniform distribution (ikr), which is denoted by:
$$X\sim U\,(a,b)$$
Since we want $\displaystyle\int^a_{b}f(x)=1$:
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}$$
for $a\leq x\leq b$

The cumulative distribution function is:
$$F(x)=\int^x_{-\infty} \frac{1}{b-a}dt=\frac{x-a}{b-a} $$
and obviously, for $a\leq x\leq b$

Expectation and standard deviation are illustrated on the picture (pls don't ask). In case of you being so fking unnecessarily enthusiastic, there you go

$$I'm~too~lazy ~for~those,~bye~:3$$
Moreover, with given $X\sim U\,(a,b)$, we can make it become 
$U(0,1)$, which is called ==Standard Uniform Distribution== by using the linear transformation
$$Y=\frac{X-a}{b-a}$$
