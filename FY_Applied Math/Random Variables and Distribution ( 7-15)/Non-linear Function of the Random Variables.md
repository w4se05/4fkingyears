Example:
	$Y=X^2$
	$Y=\sqrt{ X }$
	$Y=\frac{1}{X+1}$
	$Y=e^X$

With X is a given random variable 

We cannot directly calculate the expectation and variance of $Y$ if $Y$ is a non-linear function of X. Therefore, we have to find its probability mass/density function. The procedure is:
$$f_{X}(x)\implies F_{X}\implies F_{Y}\implies f_{Y}(y)$$
