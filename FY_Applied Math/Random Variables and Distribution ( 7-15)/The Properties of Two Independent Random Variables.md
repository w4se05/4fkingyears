Consider the basis of [[Independent Events]]
![[Independent Events#^7d58a9]] 
![[Independent Events#^7818bb]]
We have the properties of two independent variable, which are similar to that of random events.
$$p_{ij}=p_{i+}*p_{+j}$$
$$p_{i|Y=y_{j}}=P(X=i|Y=i)=\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{+j}}=\frac{p_{i+}*p_{+j}}{p_{+j}}=p_{i+}$$
Please remember that $p_{+j}$ is the [[Marginal Probability Mass Function]] of $Y=j$
