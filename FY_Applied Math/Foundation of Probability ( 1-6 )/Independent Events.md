 >[!Definition]
 >Two events A and B are independent if:  $P(B|A) = P(B)$
### Consequently: 

 $P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = P(A) * P(B)$ ^7d58a9
### and
 
  $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)*P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$ ^7818bb
#### From a practical standpoint, two events are independent when they are ==unrelated== to each other.
