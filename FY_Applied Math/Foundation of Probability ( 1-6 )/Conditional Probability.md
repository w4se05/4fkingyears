# The formula is:
# $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{ for } P(B) > 0$
## This measure the probability that A occurs when it is already known that B has happened before

# If A and B are [[Mutually Exclusive]], then:
# $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0}{P(B)} = 0$
# If A âŠƒ B, then: 

# $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B)}{P(B)} = 1$

# Note that: P(A|B) + P(A'|B) = 1 
## ( similar to P(A) + P(A') = 1)
