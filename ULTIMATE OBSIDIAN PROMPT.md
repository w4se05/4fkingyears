I want you to create a comprehensive, Obsidian-ready `.md` file for my course on **[Subject or Topic Name]**.

Follow this exact structure and style:

**Formatting Requirements:**

- Write in clean Markdown (`.md`) with full LaTeX math support (`$$...$$`).
    
- Use Obsidian callouts (`> [!Definition]`, `> [!Theorem]`, `> [!Example]`, etc.) with emojis for visual separation.
    
- Organize content with clear headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) and consistent spacing.
    
- All symbols or variables must be explained **inline** the first time they appear.
    

**Structural Requirements:**

1. **Conceptual Section (Teach Mode)**
    
    - Definitions, formulas, theorems, and properties written concisely.
        
    - Logical progression: Definition → Concept → Property → Implication.
        
    - Short notes using callouts like “> [!Note]” or “> [!Property]”.
        
2. **Application Section (Exam Mode)**
    
    - Group all examples at the end under “📘 Examples & Applications”.
        
    - Each example begins with a tag showing what knowledge it uses _(Using: …)_.
        
    - Full, step-by-step worked solutions in LaTeX math form.
        
3. **Summary Section**
    
    - Concise recap of the key results and facts for exam revision.
        
    - End with a ✅ “End of File — [Topic]” line.
        

**Pedagogical Tone:**

- Write it as a clear, exam-oriented manual — no fluff or filler.
    
- Every section should be self-contained and logically connected.
    
- Integrate at least 2–4 examples reflecting the complexity of actual exam problems.
	
- Skip all the historical background if exists.
-
Finally, make it **comprehensive** — all essential definitions, theorems, and methods from the topic must be included

If I upload my course notes, use them as the base to ensure full coverage of my syllabus.
